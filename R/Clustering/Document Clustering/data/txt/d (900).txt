This paper makes two contributions. The first is STUN¡X
Scalable Tracking Using Networked Sensors¡Xa scalable
tracking architecture that employs hierarchical structure to
allow the system to handle a large number of tracked objects.
The design of this architecture is the topic of Section II.
Our second contribution is DAB (drain-and-balance)¡Xa
method to construct STUN¡¦s hierarchical structure based on
expected properties of the object movement patterns such as
the frequency of object movements over a region. Utilizing
these properties permits it to build hierarchies which are more
efficient than those constructed without. The DAB method is
described in Section III. We demonstrate the benefits of DAB
in Section IV by applying it to 1D and 2D sensor network
topologies.
