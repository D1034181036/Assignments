Given an arity n ? N and n finite sets (Di )i=1..n, let R ? 뫔i=1..nDi (뫔i=1..nDi
stands for D1 뫔 D2 뫔 멣 멣 멣 뫔 Dn) the n-ary relation where patterns are to be discovered.
All along this article, R denotes this dataset. Table 1 represents an example of
such a relation RE ? {뮾, 뮿, ^} 뫔 {1, 2, 3, 4} 뫔 {A, B,C}, hence a ternary relation.
In this table, every 몬1몭 at the intersection of three elements stands for the presence
of the related triplet in RE . For example the bold 몬1몭 at the intersection of the elements
뮾, 1 and A means (뮾, 1, A) ? RE . On the contrary a 몬0몭 in Table 1 is at
the intersection of three elements that form a triplet absent from RE . For example
the bold 몬0몭means (뮾, 2,C) /? RE . N-ary relations are available in many application
domains. For instance, RE could represent customers (1, 2, 3 and 4) buying
items (A, B and C) along three months (뮾, 뮿 and ^ ). In this context, the bold 몬1몭
in Table 1 would mean that 몮Customer 1 bought Item A during the first month몯. The
bold 몬0몭 would be understood as 몮Customer 2 did not buy Item C during the first
month몯.
More generally, binary relation mining has been quite popular in the many application
domains where we can record Boolean properties of sets of Objects, i. e., mining
an Objects 뫔 Properties relation. A generic though common context can be to add
spatial and/or time information to get an Objects 뫔 Properties 뫔 Dates and/or an
Objects뫔Properties뫔Dates뫔Places relations. Among others, we are interested
by dynamic graph description by means of n-ary relations. The idea is that the two
first dimensions correspond to the vertices such that we encode the graph incidence
matrix. Given RE could represent vertices (1, 2, 3 and 4) which can be linked or not
to the vertices (A, B and C) along three time-stamps (뮾, 뮿 and ^ ). In this context,
the bold 몬1몭 in Table 1 would mean Vertex 1 is connected to Vertex A at the first
time-stamps. Section 6 is a case study on a real graph which evolves in two temporal
dimensions.
